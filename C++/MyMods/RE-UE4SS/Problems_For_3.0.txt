This file contains problems that are considered unsuitable for a feature release and must wait for a major release like 3.0.

The following hooks exposed to Lua allow all parameters to be modified:
InitGameState
BeginPlay

However, the following hooks exposed to Lua do NOT allow all parameters to be modified:
CallFunctionByNameWithArguments
	Modifiable = 'this' ptr, executor
	Umodifiable = str, ar, bForceCallWithNonExec
ProcessConsoleExec
	Modifiable = 'this' ptr, executor
	Unmodifiable = cmd, ar
RegisterConsoleCommandGlobalHandler
	Modifiable = None
	Unmodifiable = 'this' ptr, cmd, ar, executor
RegisterConsoleCommandHandler
	Modifiable = None
	Unmodifiable = 'this' ptr, cmd, ar, executor

This inconsistency should be fixed in the next major release.
It should be in the next major release because scripts that currently use these hooks will break if we change how the parameters are brought across from C++ to Lua.
We also don't currently have a way to transport a non-UE value containerized from C++ to Lua which is the only way to make parameters modifiable.
